# 1. KPBS-Pre-Interview-Assignment


## 1.1. Instructions
- Attached is the "pre-interview assignment". Please complete it and send the items in the README.md document back to me before the interview. 
- As mentioned in the README.md document, we're looking for a combination of hard and soft skills. KPBS is willing and happy to invest in both as needed for the right candidate.
For the best assessment completion experience, we recommend using a text editor that can display a live preview in your web browser as you make changes. 
- All sections of the file have issues that need to be addressed, so feel free to start wherever you feel the most comfortable.
- While some problems can be seen directly on the rendered page, others will require careful inspection of the source code.
