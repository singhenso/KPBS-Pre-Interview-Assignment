# 1. KPBS-Pre-Interview-Assignment


## 1.1. Instructions
- Attached is the "pre-interview assignment". Please complete it and send the items in the README.md document back to me before the interview. 
- As mentioned in the README.md document, we're looking for a combination of hard and soft skills. KPBS is willing and happy to invest in both as needed for the right candidate.
For the best assessment completion experience, we recommend using a text editor that can display a live preview in your web browser as you make changes. 
- All sections of the file have issues that need to be addressed, so feel free to start wherever you feel the most comfortable.
- While some problems can be seen directly on the rendered page, others will require careful inspection of the source code.

## 1.2. Summary

The document you've received has been designed to evaluate your general knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as your ability to communicate to the different types of "clients" within KPBS.

The real-world problems and challenges it contains can be grouped into the following categories:

- Design
- Communication
- Semantic markup
- UX / Usability
- Accessibility
- Appearance on mobile devices
- Troubleshooting & bugs
- Best practices
- Attention to detail

Please complete the following, send to me before the interview, and be prepared to discuss your work during the interview.

1. Resolve the issues and return the index.html document with your fixes.
2. Document your changes, in a style similar to a git commit message.
3. Document your work to a staff member that has little to no technical understanding who asked you to resolve one of these issues or implement a design or development request.
4. Create an email or Slack message to a Digital department team member showing how you'd ask for help when you're stuck trying trying to complete a task, fix a bug, or generally get "unstuck". 
5. The footer has been intentionally left blank. Implement one similar to what appears on kpbs.org.


## 1.3. Notes
